**This code: creates a table of dispensary density by socioeconomic factors**

1.  [matches zip codes to census geocodes](https://brookemwalters.github.io/Nimby_Site/Label%20the%20Dispensaries%20with%20GeoCodes_step2.html#match-the-files-to-the-county-codes "match the files to the county codes")

2.  [connects to census API](https://brookemwalters.github.io/Nimby_Site/Label%20the%20Dispensaries%20with%20GeoCodes_step2.html#pull-in-the-census-data-with-tidy-census)

3.  [pulls in demographic populations](https://brookemwalters.github.io/Nimby_Site/Label%20the%20Dispensaries%20with%20GeoCodes_step2.html#pull-in-the-census-data-with-tidy-census)

4.  [calculates poverty, race, and employment count rates](https://brookemwalters.github.io/Nimby_Site/Label%20the%20Dispensaries%20with%20GeoCodes_step2.html#find-the-race-poverty-and-employment-rates-at-the-county-level)

5.  [matches the statistics above with year-over-year changes in dispensaries](https://brookemwalters.github.io/Nimby_Site/Label%20the%20Dispensaries%20with%20GeoCodes_step2.html#match-the-change-in-dispensary-density-with-demographics)

6.  [creates a table showing dispensary YOY growth by socioeconomic quartiles](https://brookemwalters.github.io/Nimby_Site/Label%20the%20Dispensaries%20with%20GeoCodes_step2.html#put-everything-together)

### match geographic shape files to dispensary zip codes

grab tract info from the tigris package

## this is not an ideal way to match dispensaries to tracts, as they overlap

### match the files to the county codes

```{r}

write.csv(dsps, "~/gvsu/winter 23/CIS 635/NIMBY/cleaning/counting_dispensaries/dps_data_cleaned/dispenaries_tracts.csv")
```

### count the dispensaries

```{r}

### pull in the census data with Tidy Census

the paper looks at the poverty rate, percent black, percent Hispanic, and the employment rate demographic data comes from the U.S. Census 2014 American Community Survey 5-year sample, and employment data comes from the U.S. Census 2013 Origin-Destination Employment Statistics

# 
# rename the columns
