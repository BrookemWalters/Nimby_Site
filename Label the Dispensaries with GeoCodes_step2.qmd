**This code: creates a table of dispensary density by socioeconomic factors**

1.  matches zip codes to census geocodes
2.  connects to census API
3.  retrieves demographic population data
4.  calculates poverty, race, and employment rates
5.  matches the statistics above with year-over-year changes in dispensaries
6.  generates an overly formatted table showing dispensary YOY growth by socioeconomic quartiles\

This section of my methodology was the most exciting for me, yet it was also where I recognized the need to adapt my approach. My first limitation was the challenge of matching dispensary locations to their corresponding census tracts. To achieve this, I would need to obtain each location's physical address, which was not provided by Colorado.Gov's dispensary archive. While this information can be accessed for a price through vendors or tediously scraping the web, for the sake of time and sanity, proceeding with county-level data was my best option for completing this project.

Nonetheless, the TIGRIS package's ability to create maps at the census tract level remains a potent instrument in an analyst's arsenal. Although the tract level identifiers are not utilized beyond this point, I have included it as a reference for future projects and as part of my Replicating NIMBY journey. Due to the differences in methodology, my figures do not align flawlessly; however, examining the overall trends for congruence remains a worthwhile endeavor.

### load packages

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate) # filter for just the month of December
library(sf) # spacial data
library(tigris) # to pull in census boundaries
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE) # save to local memory
library(tidycensus) # to pull demographic data from the census
library(tidyverse)
library(gt)# formatting an interactive table
```

### import data

```{r}
# list of dispensaries
dsps <-  as.data.frame(read.csv("~/gvsu/winter 23/CIS 635/NIMBY/cleaning/counting_dispensaries/dps_data_cleaned/dispensary_types_defined.csv"))

# list of all zip codes with at lease one dispensary
dsps_zips <-  as.data.frame(read.csv("~/gvsu/winter 23/CIS 635/NIMBY/cleaning/counting_dispensaries/dps_data_cleaned/dsps_zips.csv"))

#county geocodes scraped from Wikipedia
county_codes <- (read.csv("~/gvsu/winter 23/CIS 635/NIMBY/cleaning/density tables/county_FIPS_codes.csv"))
```

### spatial join between dispensary locations and geocodes

At this stage, the zip codes are my main geographical identifier for my dispensary data frame. In an attempt to find the tract level data, I tapped into the Tigris package. [*adapted from "[tigris](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris "Kyle Walker")"*]{style="font-size: 80%;"}

```{r, echo=FALSE}
zctas <- zctas(state = 08, year = 2010, class = "sf")
tracts <- tracts(state = 08, year = 2010, class = "sf")

zip_tracts<- st_join(zctas, tracts) # Perform the spatial join.

# Keep only the relevant columns
zip_tracts <- st_set_geometry(zip_tracts, NULL) # remove the spacial codes
zip_tracts <-  zip_tracts %>% # grabbing the geocodes
  select(ZCTA5CE10,COUNTYFP, TRACTCE10,  NAME10,NAMELSAD10, GEOID10.y)

# update the column names
colnames(zip_tracts) <- c("zip",
                          "county_code",
                          "census tract",
                          "tract_code",
                          "tract name",
                          "GEOID")

# pull in the dispesnary geographies 
dsps_zips$zip<-  as.character(dsps_zips$zip) # convert to character
dsps_zips <- distinct(dsps_zips, zip) # just keep the zips
dsps_geos <- left_join(dsps_zips, zip_tracts, by = "zip")


## this is not an ideal way to match dispensaries to tracts, as they overlap
dsps_geos<- dsps_geos %>% 
  group_by(zip) %>% 
  slice(1)
```

\

### match the files to the county codes with join

```{r}
# time to add the spacial data to my dispensary list!
dsps$zip <-  as.character(dsps$zip) # convert_back to characters
dsps<- left_join(dsps, dsps_geos, by = "zip")
dsps$county_code <-  as.integer(dsps$county_code) # using an intgers to join other datasets

# a lovely document with dispensary tracts and county codes
dsps<- left_join(dsps, county_codes, by = "county_code")

# saving for later in case I can use the tract level data
write.csv(dsps, "~/gvsu/winter 23/CIS 635/NIMBY/cleaning/counting_dispensaries/dps_data_cleaned/dispenaries_tracts.csv")
```

 

### count the dispensaries with summarize

```{r}
dsps_summed <-  dsps %>% 
  filter(month(date) == 12) %>% 
  filter(year < 2017) %>% 
  select(dba, county_code, "GEOID" =GEOID.y, year) %>% 
  group_by(year, GEOID) %>% 
  summarise(num_licenses = n()) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = num_licenses, values_fill = 0)

write.csv(dsps_summed, "~/gvsu/winter 23/CIS 635/NIMBY/cleaning/counting_dispensaries/dps_data_cleaned/dispensary_counts_county_year.csv")
```

### retrieve census population data with Tidy Census

the paper looks at the poverty rate, percent black, percent Hispanic, and the employment rate demographic data comes from the U.S. Census 2014 American Community Survey 5-year sample, and employment data comes from the U.S. Census 2013 Origin-Destination Employment Statistics

I've already established an API census_api_key("\[API removed for privacy\]", install = TRUE)

[SocialExplore.com](https://www.socialexplorer.com/data/ACS2013_5yr/metadata/?ds=ACS13_5yr&var=B17001001) is a helpful website for definitions:

```{r}
#I've already established an API census_api_key
#("\[API removed for privacy\]", install= TRUE)

demo_factors <- get_acs(
  year = 2014,
  geography = "county",
  state = "CO",
  variables = c(population_14 = "B01001_001",
                pov_base_14 = "B17001_001", # Universe: Population for whom poverty status Is determined (base of % poverty)
                pov_pop_14 = "B17001_002", # Income in the Past 12 Months Below Poverty Level
                employeed = "B23025_002", # employed in labor for (16+)
                black = "B03002_004",
                hispanic = "B03002_012"),

  output = "wide"
) 
# i look forward to the day when the racial makeup of a zip code isn't an assumed identifier for poverty
colnames(demo_factors)
```

\

### match the change in dispensary density with demographics

Here I join two datasets using "GEOID", aggregate the annual population and demographic factors by geographic ID. Next, I created new variables representing the total population and economic indicators for each geographic ID. The resulting dataset has one row per unique geographic ID.

```{r}
# switching from merging to left joins since it's easier to read
demo_factors$GEOID <-  as.integer(demo_factors$GEOID)
dsps_summed$GEOID <-  as.integer(dsps_summed$GEOID)

dsps_yoy_demos <- left_join(demo_factors, dsps_summed, by = "GEOID")
colnames(dsps_yoy_demos)

dsps_yoy_demos <- dsps_yoy_demos %>%
  mutate_at(vars(15:18), replace_na, replace = 0) %>%
  group_by(GEOID) %>% # add the total ins
  summarize(
    pop_2014 = sum(population_14E),
    pov_pop_14 = sum(pov_pop_14E),
    pov_base = sum(pov_base_14E),
    black_pop = sum(blackE),
    hispanic_pop = sum(hispanicE),
    employeed_pop = sum(employeedE),
    `2013` = sum(`2013`),
    `2014` = sum(`2014`),
    `2015` = sum(`2015`),
    `2016` = sum(`2016`)
  )

```

 

## year-over-year function

One of former professors told me, if you have do write something three times then it's time to write a function! The year over year variance is another crucial aspect of NIMBY's model. This function will be applied to several variables

```{r}
# make a function to calculate the year over year changes
yoy_avg_function <- function(df) {
  # calculate  growth rates
  df$yoy_2014 <- ((df$`2014` - df$`2013`) / df$`2013`) 
  df$yoy_2015 <- ((df$`2015` - df$`2014`) / df$`2014`) 
  df$yoy_2016 <- ((df$`2016` - df$`2015`) / df$`2015`) 
  
  # average growth rate and round to 3 decimal places
  df$dsp_yoy_avg <- rowMeans(df[, c("yoy_2014", "yoy_2015", "yoy_2016")], na.rm = TRUE)
  df <- df %>% mutate_at(vars(starts_with("dsp")), funs(round(., 3))) # round
  
  return(df)
}
```

\

### calculate the year-over-year change average in dispensaries for the state of Colorado

```{r}
colorado_yoy_average <-  dsps_yoy_demos %>% 
  summarize(
    `2013` = sum(`2013`),
    `2014` = sum(`2014`),
    `2015` = sum(`2015`),
    `2016` = sum(`2016`)
  )

colorado_yoy_average <-  yoy_avg_function(colorado_yoy_average) %>% 
  select("Colorado Average" = dsp_yoy_avg)
```

### find the race, poverty and employment rates at the county level

```{r}
# make the rates
# create the percentages:
dsps_yoy_demos  <- dsps_yoy_demos %>% 
  #create percentages  
  mutate(pct_poverty_rate = (pov_pop_14/pov_base),
         pct_black = (black_pop/ pop_2014),
         pct_hispanic = (hispanic_pop/ pop_2014)) %>% 
  #round
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("pct")), funs(round(., 3)))
```

### create quartiles to recreate table1

![table1 from the original paper is my second reference at cross comparing my results against NIMBY's](images/Table1.png)

Using the ntile function, I classify the dispensary year-over-year changes by counties quartiles of the various variables

```{r}
dsps_yoy_demos <- dsps_yoy_demos %>% 
  mutate(qrt_pov = ntile(pct_poverty_rate,4)) %>% 
  mutate(qrt_black = ntile(pct_black,4)) %>%
  mutate(qrt_hispanic = ntile(pct_hispanic,4)) %>% 
  mutate(qrt_employment = ntile(employeed_pop,4))

# calculate the YOY average
dsps_yoy_qtiles <- yoy_avg_function(dsps_yoy_demos) 
# save the data for the crime per capita calculations
write.csv(dsps_yoy_qtiles, "~/gvsu/winter 23/CIS 635/NIMBY/cleaning/counting_dispensaries/dps_data_cleaned/dsps_yoy_qtiles.csv")
```

\

transform the data into a tabluar format to be presented in a simple summarized table

```{r warning=FALSE}
# poverty quartiles by dispensary density
