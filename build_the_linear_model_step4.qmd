Notes from NIMBY:

# variable checklist

# Δcrime_i,t: This is the dependent variable in the regression. It represents 
# the year-over-year change in crime rates for county i in year t. 
# This variable is the one we are trying to explain with the other variables in the regression.



# 𝛽0: This is the intercept term in the regression equation. 
# It represents the expected value of Δcrime_i,t when all the independent
# variables in the regression are equal to zero.

# 𝛽1: This is the coefficient on the year-over-year change in the number of 
# dispensaries (Δdisp_i,t). It represents the expected change in Δcrime_i,t 
# for a one-unit increase in Δdisp_i,t, holding all other variables constant.


# Δdisp_i,t: This is the year-over-year change in the number of dispensaries 
# for county i in year t. It is one of the independent variables in the regression.
